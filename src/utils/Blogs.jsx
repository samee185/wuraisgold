          The foundation recognizes the importance of Goal 4, which aims to
          provide quality education and training to promote lifelong learning
          opportunities for everyone while ensuring inclusivity and equity. In
          line with this goal, the foundation will be focusing on crucial
          outcome targets of Goal 4, including:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc px-5">
          <li>
            We ensure access to quality early childhood development, care, and
            pre-primary education for both sexes, preparing them for primary
            education.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increasing the number of young people and adults with relevant
            skills, including technical and vocational skills, can lead to
            employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are eliminating gender disparities in education and ensuring
            equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for
            vulnerable individuals, including persons with disabilities,
            indigenous peoples, and children in vulnerable situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is building and upgrading education facilities that are gender,
            disability, and child-sensitive. These facilities will provide safe,
            nonviolent, inclusive, and effective learning environments for all.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The foundation believes that by focusing on these key outcome targets,
          we can contribute to achieving the overall goal of ensuring quality
          education and training for all, promoting lifelong learning
          opportunities, and creating a more inclusive and equitable society.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attainment of quality education and training is critical to
          achieving sustainable development, particularly regarding SDG 4. It is
          necessary to remove obstacles that impede skills development and
          technical and vocational education and training (TVET) starting from
          secondary to tertiary levels, including universities, and provide
          lifelong learning opportunities for young adults and adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assurance of quality must accompany the expansion of equitable
          access to TVET. To ensure that all youth and adults, especially girls
          and women, acquire relevant knowledge, skills, and competencies for
          decent work and life, it is imperative to diversify and increase
          learning opportunities using various education and training
          modalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to work-specific skills, equal emphasis should be placed
          on developing high-level cognitive and non-cognitive/transferable
          skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity,
          teamwork, communication skills, and conflict resolution, which are
          transferable across various occupational fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          All individuals, regardless of their sex, age, race, colour,
          ethnicity, language, religion, political or other opinions, national
          or social origin, property, or birth, as well as persons with
          disabilities, migrants, indigenous peoples, and children and youth,
          especially those in vulnerable situations or another status, should
          have access to inclusive, equitable quality education and lifelong
          learning opportunities. Vulnerable groups, such as persons with
          disabilities, indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and the poor,
          require particular attention and targeted strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equal opportunities for quality education and similar benefits from
          education should be affordable to all girls and boys, women and men.
          Adolescent girls and young women, who may be subject to gender-based
          violence, child marriage, early pregnancy, and heavy household chores,
          as well as those living in poor and remote rural areas, require
          special attention. In contexts where boys are disadvantaged, targeted
          actions are needed. Gender inequality policies are more effective when
          they are part of an overall package that promotes health, justice,
          good governance, and freedom from child labour.
        </p>
        <p>
          This target addresses the need for adequate physical infrastructure
          and safe, inclusive environments that nurture learning for all,
          regardless of background or disability status.
        </p>
        <p>
          MENTORSHIP: Children/young adults mentorship is one of the aims of the
          education under the umbrella of the WGCF, and this is part of the
          fundamental ways to improve the well-being of these teens socially,
          helping them provide advice in their career paths, capacity building,
          encouraging their God-given talents, and by providing role models and
          mentors that can support these teens academically, socially and
          personally, this work can be accomplished through school work,
          communication, and other well monitored social activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mentorship relationship could help the teens develop excellent
          social skills, form constructive relationships with others, and
          develop positive behaviours and aspirations; these mentors will assist
          the children/teens in achieving their personal or career goals,
          introducing them to new ways of thinking, challenging their limiting
          assumptions, sharing valuable life lessons and so much more.

          The foundation recognizes the importance of Goal 4, which aims to
          provide quality education and training to promote lifelong learning
          opportunities for everyone while ensuring inclusivity and equity. In
          line with this goal, the foundation will be focusing on crucial

        <ul className="list-disc px-5">

            We ensure access to quality early childhood development, care, and

            education.

          <li>
            Increasing the number of young people and adults with relevant

          </li>
          <li>
            We are eliminating gender disparities in education and ensuring
            equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for
            vulnerable individuals, including persons with disabilities,

            It is building and upgrading education facilities that are gender,
            disability, and child-sensitive. These facilities will provide safe,

        </p>
        <p>
          The attainment of quality education and training is critical to
          achieving sustainable development, particularly regarding SDG 4. It is
          necessary to remove obstacles that impede skills development and
          technical and vocational education and training (TVET) starting from
          secondary to tertiary levels, including universities, and provide
          lifelong learning opportunities for young adults and adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assurance of quality must accompany the expansion of equitable
          access to TVET. To ensure that all youth and adults, especially girls
          and women, acquire relevant knowledge, skills, and competencies for
          decent work and life, it is imperative to diversify and increase
          learning opportunities using various education and training
          modalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to work-specific skills, equal emphasis should be placed
          on developing high-level cognitive and non-cognitive/transferable
          skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity,
          teamwork, communication skills, and conflict resolution, which are
          transferable across various occupational fields.

          disabilities, migrants, indigenous peoples, and children and youth,

          have access to inclusive, equitable quality education and lifelong
          learning opportunities. Vulnerable groups, such as persons with
          disabilities, indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and the poor,
          require particular attention and targeted strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equal opportunities for quality education and similar benefits from
          education should be affordable to all girls and boys, women and men.

          violence, child marriage, early pregnancy, and heavy household chores,
          as well as those living in poor and remote rural areas, require
          special attention. In contexts where boys are disadvantaged, targeted
          actions are needed. Gender inequality policies are more effective when
